# Covid-19-diseases-Predictions
Predicting the Covid-19 Diseases

The main aim of this project is to  predict the COVID â€“ 19 disease by employing various machine learning techniques.
Imported the necessary libraries like Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly etc.
Implemented the Machie learing algorithm like Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Classiser and also XGBoost classiifier. 
Therefore ploted the graph to compare accuracy using different classifier.
