# Covid-19-diseases-Predictions
Predicting the Covid-19 Diseases

The main aim of this project is to  predict the COVID â€“ 19 disease by employing various machine learning techniques.
Imported the necessary libraries like Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly etc.
Implemented the Machine learning algorithm like Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Classiser and also XGBoost classiifier. 
Therefore plotted the graph to compare accuracy using different classifier.
